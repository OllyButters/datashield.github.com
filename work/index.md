D2K was founded in 2011 to bring together researchers with a common interest in the tools and methodologies of the translation of data into knowledge. D2K, as a transdisciplinary research group, focuses on the conduct and study of design, development and application of tools and methodologies aimed at supporting generation, management, evaluation, analysis and interpretation of data and information.

## Principal areas of interest

#### Bioinformatics

Methods and tools to promote liberal, but socially, ethically and legally acceptable and appropriate, access to contemporary biomedical/social data (with Epidemiology, Social Science & Humanities) and to facilitate their use in driving knowledge generation and health translation; 

#### Epidemiology

Design and harmonization of biobanks and other large scale biomedical studies and the analysis of the data they generate (with Bioinformatics, Social Science & Humanities); 

#### Social Studies of Health Science

Social studies of data generation, governance, utilisation and translation; developing methods to support transdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder engagement to facilitate the transformation of data into policy and practice.
