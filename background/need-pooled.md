Contemporary exploration of the biomedical and social determinants of health and disease often requires scientists to identify and quantify the relatively weak effect of one or more factors of primary relevance (e.g. a small number of specified genes and environmental determinants) that are shrouded behind a smoke-screen of other factors that are causally important but not of substantive interest in the current study (i.e. all of the other determinants that influence the trait of interest). This is akin to fine-tuning a radio – it demands that the signal to noise ratio is large enough to allow clear reception. In the biomedical setting this often means that a very large number of subjects must be studied ([Burton et al., 2009](/references)). At the same time, studies must invest in measurements that are of ‘high quality’([Wong et al., 2003](/references)) and this can be very expensive when tens or even hundreds of thousands of participants are to be measured. This places a pragmatic limit on the total number of subjects that any single study can enrol and many research questions of undoubted scientific interest simply cannot be answered on the basis of data from one study alone. Instead, leading research groups are increasingly combining data from more than one study and are carrying out large pooled meta-analyses ([Hindorff et al., 2009](/references), [Burton et al., 2009](/references)). But this approach imposes two absolute requirements on the available data:

1. Any studies to be co-analysed must be ‘harmonized’ in the sense that the information to be pooled between them must have a meaning that is sufficiently similar to render a combined analysis meaningful ([Fortier et al., 2010](/references), [Burton et al., 2010](/references).
2. The chosen approach to analysis must be legally and ethically acceptable in the light of the ethical and governance stipulations that have been placed on each of the studies to be pooled. For example, data from individual participants cannot simply be passed on to a centre that will undertake a combined meta-analysis if the consent forms that participants signed in one of the studies indicated that individual-level data would never be released to third parties.

This presents a real challenge. Many studies and governmental data repositories do have strict embargoes on the release of individual-level data ([Wallace et al., 2008](/references)). These may be framed in the wording of consent forms or information leaflets, the concerns of ethical committees, or legal restrictions placed by governments or other controlling bodies on national data access and release. Sometimes the prohibition is all encompassing (no data can be passed to any third party) but it is often targeted (e.g. data cannot be passed across national boundaries; or social data can be shared but not biomedical data). Furthermore, even when access is theoretically permitted, governance procedures may well stipulate that researchers must seek formal permission from one or more oversight bodies and/or ethics committees, and these procedures are often so time-consuming that researchers are discouraged from applying for data access.
