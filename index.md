Data synthesis is often most effective if it is based on an analysis of individual-level data pooled across contributing studies rather than on a conventional meta-analysis of study-level summary statistics. But valid ethico-legal constraints often prohibit or discourage the sharing of individual-level data. DataSHIELD provides a novel approach to data synthesis, based on parallel processing and distributed computing, that circumvents this conflict.
